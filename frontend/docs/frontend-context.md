# 16signals — FRONTEND CONTEXT

## Product Overview

Colosseum is an evidence-based hiring platform for developers.

The platform replaces CV claims with verifiable proof-of-work derived from:
- GitHub activity
- Open source contributions
- Technical ownership
- Consistency over time
- Stack usage
- Web3 on-chain activity
- Reputation/vouch systems

The platform focuses on:
- reducing hiring noise
- reducing ghost jobs
- improving interview quality
- improving candidate matching
- increasing recruiter confidence
- surfacing real technical ability

The product is NOT:
- a social network
- a portfolio website
- a crypto casino UI
- a generic ATS dashboard
- a developer analytics toy

The product SHOULD feel like:
- a technical intelligence platform
- a recruiter decision system
- a trusted hiring layer
- a modern evidence engine
